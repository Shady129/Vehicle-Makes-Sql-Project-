# Vehicle Makes Analysis 

## Project Objectives:
•	Utilized SQL to import more than 300K records for vehicle makes details to database.
•	Extract data from database to a separate table.
•	Extract data from different related tables from vehicle makes databases using JOIN and VIEW.
•	Transformed and filtered data by using aggregating and filtering function to extract valuable insights.
     •	EDA involved exploring the Vehicle Makes data to answer key almost 50 questions related to:
     
          -	Kinds of cars and their fuel type.
          -	The capacity of engines that are used in vehicles.
